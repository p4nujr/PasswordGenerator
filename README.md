## PasswordGenerator by p4nujr 

**Generate random and secure passwords:**
Passwords are a real security threat. A recent report reveals that more than 80% of vulnerabilities related to hacker attacks are due to weak or stolen passwords. So if you want to protect your personal information and assets, creating strong passwords is a great first step. That's when the PasswordGenerator can help. 
Uncrackable passwords are complex and include various types of characters (numbers, letters, and symbols). Using a different password for each website or app also helps protect against hacker attacks. This password generator tool runs locally on your Windows, Mac, or Linux computer, as well as on your iOS or Android device. The passwords you generate are never sent over the Internet.

#### Some password recommendations :)
Always use a unique password for each account you create. The danger of reusing passwords is that as soon as a website faces a security issue, it becomes very easy for hackers to try the same username and password combination on other websites.
Do not use personal information in your passwords. Names, birthdays, and postal addresses may be easy to remember, but they can also be easily found on the Internet, and their use as passwords should always be avoided to ensure maximum security.
Make sure passwords are at least 16 characters long and contain letters, numbers, and special characters.
If you're going to create a master password that you'll have to remember, try using phrases or lyrics from your favorite movie or song. Just add random characters, but don't replace them using simple patterns.
Use a password generator like PasswordGenerator to create sufficiently strong passwords. We will keep your data protected from attacks or spies.
Avoid commonly used weak passwords like asd123, password1, or Temp!. Examples of strong passwords include: S&2x4S12nLS1*, JANa@sx3l2&s$, 49915w5$oYmH.
Avoid using personal information for your security questions; instead, use PasswordGenerator to generate another "password" and save it as the answer to these questions. The reason? Hackers can easily find some of this information, such as the name of the street you grew up on or your favorite pet, and use it in a brute force attack to access your accounts.
Avoid using similar passwords where only one word or character changes. This practice weakens the security of your accounts on various websites.
Change your passwords as soon as you have a reason to, such as when you've shared them with someone, after a website breach, or if it's been more than a year since you last updated them.

#### Do you save my generated password?
No, the generated passwords are random and unknown to us, since it is an autonomous application that you will run on your own computer.

#### Terms of use:
This program is only an aid to create more secure keys, but it does not guarantee your total security. The choice of a password is ultimately the responsibility of the user, like good habits so that the password is not stolen through social engineering or any other hacking method.
