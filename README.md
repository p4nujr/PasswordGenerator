## Extra
#### [Best practices for Strong Passwords]
- Always use a unique password for each account to prevent the reuse of your password on multiple services in case of a breach.
- Avoid including personal information such as names, birthdates, or addresses in your passwords, as this data can be easily accessible online.
- Ensure that your passwords are at least 16 characters long and contain a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
- Use a password generator like PasswordGenerator to create highly secure passwords, ensuring that the password is highly complex and unpredictable.
- Avoid commonly used weak passwords like "asd123," "password1," or "Temp!" Instead, opt for strong examples like "S&2x4S12nLS1*," "JANa@sx3l2&s$," or "49915w5$oYmH."
- Refrain from using personal information as answers to security questions.
- Avoid using similar passwords where only one word or character varies, as this compromises the security of your accounts on various websites.
- Change your passwords promptly if you have shared them, after a website security breach, or if more than a year has passed since the last update to maintain optimal security.

#### [Do you save my generated passwords?]
No, your generated passwords are random and remain confidential, as it is a self-contained application that you will run on your own computer.

#### [Terms of use:]
This program is only an aid to create more secure keys, but it does not guarantee your total security. The choice of a password is ultimately the responsibility of the user, like good habits so that the password is not stolen through social engineering or any other hacking method.
